## About Me 

I combine journalistic instinct with the precision of machine learning to reveal nuanced insights simply and beautifully. 

Beginning my career in news and media, I am a magna cum laude graduate of the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University. 
There, I worked as a digital producer for Arizona PBS in partnership with my school's media outlet, Cronkite News. Notably, I coordinated field coverage for the 2016 general election live from the Mexican border. My first media job out of school was working as associate and part-time executive producer of the Justin, Scott and Spiegel morning show on 98 Rock Baltimore, the number one drive-time show in Baltimore, a top 25 media market, where I produced on-air segments heard and viewed online by nearly 1 million listeners in the local area and around the world (via the station app). In 2017, I left the station unexpectedly to intern at The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon where I worked as a writer's intern, effectively functioning as an extra writer's assistant for the number one show in network late night. Feeling a bit burned out from working in three top media markets (Baltimore, Phoenix and New York City), I took a year to work for Disney transportation, earning my Florida boater's license while operating the boats surrounding Magic Kingdom. A bit restless, I decided to enroll in the company's education benefits and work toward a master's degree in data science. 

After fifteen months I am poised to graduate from Bellevue University with honors armed with competitive knowledge and a diverse skill set that includes machine learning, predictive analytics, data analysis, data mining and data visualization across multiple languages including Python, R and SQL and tools like Tableau and PowerBI. Toward the end of the program, I realized that I am interested in combining my technical skills with my media domain knowledge to work in a newsroom as a data visualization or data journalism specialist. My culminating project for my capstone course is an accessible visualization and classification of businesses that received paycheck protection federal aid during the pandemic. I intend to not only create a notebook to display the results to employers, but also to create universally accessible visualizations to upload to a Medium page I am starting dedicated to my data journalism work.
